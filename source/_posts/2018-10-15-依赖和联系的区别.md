[Martin Fowler 的观点][1]：

> In general, you use an association to represent something like a field
> in a class. The link is always there, in that you can always ask an
> order for its customer. It need not actually be a field, if you are
> modeling from a more interface perspective, it can just indicate the
> presence of a method that will return the order's customer.

简而言之，一个类中的一个字段，或者一个 getter 意味着联系。

> To quote from the 3rd edition of UML Distilled (now just out) "a
> dependency exists between two elements if changes to the definition of
> one element (the supplier) may cause changes to the other (the
> client)". This is a very vague and general relationship, which is why
> the UML has a host of stereotypes for different forms of dependency.
> In code terms, such things as naming a parameter type and creating an
> object in a temporary variable imply a dependency.
> 
> You don't want to show every dependency on a UML diagram - there are
> far too many. You need to be very selective and show only those that
> are important to whatever it is you are communicating.
> 
> I tend not to use stereotypes on the dependencies very often. I find
> that most of the time the key point I want to show is that a
> dependency exists, and which kind is rather less vital.
> 
> Associations also imply dependency, if there is an association between
> two classes, there is also a dependency. But I can't imagine a case
> where you would show that dependency as an extra line on the diagram.
> The association implies it, as does a generalization.

模糊地说，client 依赖 supplier，意味着 supplier 的变动会传递到 client 上。

方法参数或者临时变量意味着为依赖。

依赖有很多形式，难以尽述。联系本身也是一种大致的依赖。
